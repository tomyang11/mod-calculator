# mod-calculator
This is a program for a calculator that solves and expands upon this discrete math problem:

For some primie numbers p, the equation x * x + 1 = 0 (mod p) has a solution in ℤ<sub>p<sub>. For other primes it does not. For example, ℤ<sub>19<sub>
Investigate the first several (say, to 103) prime numbers p and divide them into two categories: thos for which x * x + 1 = 0 (mod p) has a solution in the equivalence class of p and those for which it does not.
