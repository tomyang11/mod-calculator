# mod-calculator
This is a program for a calculator that solves and expands upon this discrete math problem:

For some prime numbers p, the equation x * x + 1 = 0 (mod p) has a solution in ℤ<sub>p</sub>. For other primes it does not. For example, in ℤ<sub>17</sub> we have 4 * 4 + 1 = 0 (mod 17), but in ℤ<sub>19</sub> there is no solution.

Investigate the first several (say, to 103) prime numbers p and divide them into two categories: thos for which x * x + 1 = 0 (mod p) has a solution in the equivalence class of p and those for which it does not.
